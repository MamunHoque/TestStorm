# Phase 2 Requirements Document - Advanced Features

## Introduction

Phase 2 of the API Load Testing & Monitoring SPA introduces intelligent automation, AI-powered insights, and advanced collaboration features. Building upon the solid foundation of Phase 1, these enhancements transform the application from a manual testing tool into an intelligent performance analysis platform. The phase focuses on automated optimization, multi-step scenario testing, advanced GraphQL capabilities, system health integration, and team collaboration features that provide deeper insights and streamlined workflows for performance engineering teams.
