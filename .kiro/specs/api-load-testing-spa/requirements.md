# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The API Load Testing & Monitoring SPA is a single-page web application that enables users to test REST and GraphQL APIs for both functional correctness and performance under load. The application provides a unified interface for API testing, load test configuration, real-time monitoring, and results visualization, all within a client-side SPA architecture with backend support for load generation and data persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test individual API endpoints for functional correctness, so that I can verify my API responses before running load tests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters an API URL, HTTP method, headers, query parameters, and request body THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for each component
2. WHEN a user selects an authentication method (Bearer token, API key, or Basic auth) THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate input fields for credentials
3. WHEN a user executes a single API test THEN the system SHALL display the response status code, response time, and formatted response body
4. WHEN the response is JSON THEN the system SHALL provide a JSON viewer for easy inspection
5. WHEN a user tests an API endpoint THEN the system SHALL complete the request and display results within 2 seconds

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a performance tester, I want to configure and run load tests with customizable parameters, so that I can simulate realistic traffic patterns against my APIs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets concurrent users, test duration, and ramp-up time THEN the system SHALL accept these parameters through intuitive controls
2. WHEN a user starts a load test THEN the system SHALL execute the test using the configured API endpoint and parameters
3. WHEN a load test is running THEN the system SHALL support at least 10,000 concurrent requests
4. WHEN a user wants to stop a test early THEN the system SHALL allow immediate test termination while preserving collected results
5. WHEN a load test completes THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive performance metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user monitoring test execution, I want to see real-time performance metrics and visualizations, so that I can understand system behavior during load testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a load test is running THEN the system SHALL display real-time charts for requests per second, average latency, and error rate
2. WHEN test results are updated THEN the system SHALL refresh visualizations within 500ms
3. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL show summary metrics including P95 latency, total requests, and success vs error rates
4. WHEN viewing charts THEN the system SHALL use interactive visualizations that allow zooming and data point inspection
5. WHEN real-time data is streaming THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth chart updates without performance degradation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user analyzing test results, I want to export and review historical test data, so that I can track performance trends and share results with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL allow users to download results in CSV and JSON formats
2. WHEN a user wants to review past tests THEN the system SHALL provide access to test history
3. WHEN viewing test history THEN the system SHALL display key metrics and timestamps for each test
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include all relevant metrics: response times, error rates, throughput, and test configuration
5. WHEN storing test results THEN the system SHALL persist data either locally or on the backend

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want a seamless single-page experience with intuitive navigation, so that I can efficiently move between testing, monitoring, and analysis without page reloads.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL present all functionality within a single page interface
2. WHEN a user navigates between sections THEN the system SHALL use tabs or panels without triggering page reloads
3. WHEN switching between API testing, load testing, and results views THEN the system SHALL maintain application state
4. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual hierarchy with API Test, Load Test, and History sections
5. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL support both dark and light themes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication credentials to be handled securely, so that my API keys and tokens are not exposed or compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters authentication credentials THEN the system SHALL store them securely in local storage
2. WHEN credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL never expose them in application logs
3. WHEN using stored credentials THEN the system SHALL only transmit them over HTTPS connections
4. WHEN the application session ends THEN the system SHALL provide options to clear stored credentials
5. WHEN handling sensitive data THEN the system SHALL follow secure coding practices for credential management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user working with different API types, I want support for both REST and GraphQL APIs, so that I can test all my API endpoints regardless of their architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing REST APIs THEN the system SHALL support all standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
2. WHEN testing GraphQL APIs THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate query and mutation input fields
3. WHEN configuring requests THEN the system SHALL allow custom headers for both REST and GraphQL endpoints
4. WHEN sending requests THEN the system SHALL properly format and transmit both REST and GraphQL payloads
5. WHEN receiving responses THEN the system SHALL correctly parse and display both REST and GraphQL response formats
